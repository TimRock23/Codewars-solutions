<summary>Square Every Digit</summary>

  + [solution](Square%20Every%20Digit.py) | [codewars link](https://www.codewars.com/kata/546e2562b03326a88e000020)

>Welcome. In this kata, you are asked to square every digit of a number and concatenate them.  
>For example, if we run `9119` through the function, `811181` will come out, 
> because `9^2` is `81` and `1^2` is `1`.
>Note: The function accepts an integer and returns an integer

<summary>Isograms</summary>

  + [solution](Isograms.py) | [codewars link](https://www.codewars.com/kata/54ba84be607a92aa900000f1)

> An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive. 
> Implement a function that determines whether a string that contains only letters 
> is an isogram. Assume the empty string is an isogram. Ignore letter case.
>
>Examples:
>
>`is_isogram("Dermatoglyphics" ) == true`
>`is_isogram("aba" ) == false`

<summary>Two to One</summary>

  + [solution](Two%20to%20One.py) | [codewars link](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5656b6906de340bd1b0000ac)

>Take 2 strings `s1` and `s2` including only letters from `a` to `z`. Return a 
> new sorted string, the longest possible, containing distinct letters - each 
> taken only once - coming from s`1` or `s2`.  
> 
> Examples:
> 
>`a = "xyaabbbccccdefww"
b = "xxxxyyyyabklmopq"`
`longest(a, b) -> "abcdefklmopqwxy"`

<summary>Ones and Zeros</summary>

  + [solution](Ones%20and%20Zeros.py) | [codewars link](https://www.codewars.com/kata/578553c3a1b8d5c40300037c)    

>Given an array of ones and zeroes, convert the equivalent binary value to an integer.  
Eg: `[0, 0, 0, 1]` is treated as 0001 which is the binary representation of `1`.
>
>Examples:
>
>`Testing: [0, 0, 1, 0] ==> 2`  
>`Testing: [0, 1, 0, 1] ==> 5`  
>`Testing: [1, 0, 0, 1] ==> 9`  
>`Testing: [1, 1, 1, 1] ==> 15`

<summary>Find the divisors! </summary>

  + [solution](Find%20the%20divisors!.py) | [codewars link](https://www.codewars.com/kata/544aed4c4a30184e960010f4)

> Create a function named `divisors`/`Divisors` that takes an integer `n > 1` and returns an array 
> with all of the integer's divisors(except for 1 and the number itself), from smallest to largest.   
> If the number is prime return the string `(integer) is prime`.
> 
> Examples:
> 
> `divisors(12); #should return [2,3,4,6]`
>`divisors(13); #should return "13 is prime"`

>Implement a function that adds two numbers together and returns their sum in binary. 
> The conversion can be done before, or after the addition.  
>The binary number returned should be a string.

<summary>Growth of a Population</summary>

  + [solution](Growth%20of%20a%20Population.py) | [codewars link](https://www.codewars.com/kata/563b662a59afc2b5120000c6)

> In a small town the population is `p0` at the beginning of a year. The population regularly increases 
> by `percent` per year and moreover `aug` new inhabitants per year come to live in the town.   
> How many years does the town need to see its population greater or equal to `p` inhabitants?    
> More generally given parameters:    
>`p0`, `percent`, `aug` (inhabitants coming or leaving each year), `p` (population to surpass)  
>the function `nb_year` should return `n` number of entire years needed to get a population greater or equal to `p`.  
>`aug` is an integer, `percent` a positive or null floating number, `p0` and `p` are positive integers (> 0)
>
>Examples:  
>`nb_year(1500, 5, 100, 5000) -> 15`  
>`nb_year(1500000, 2.5, 10000, 2000000) -> 10`

>Write a function that returns only the decimal part of the given number.  
>You only have to handle valid numbers, not `Infinity`, `NaN`, or similar. Always return a positive decimal part.  
>
>Examples  
>`get_decimal(2.4)  # 0.4`

>Return the number (count) of vowels in the given string.  
>We will consider `a, e, i, o, u` as vowels for this Kata (but not `y`).  
>The input string will only consist of lower case letters and/or spaces.
