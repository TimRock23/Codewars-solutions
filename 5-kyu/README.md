> Write a function, which takes a non-negative integer (seconds) as input and 
> returns the time in a human-readable format (`HH:MM:SS`)
> * `HH` = hours, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 99 
> * `MM` = minutes, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 59 
> * `SS` = seconds, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 59 
> 
> The maximum time never exceeds 359999 (`99:59:59`)
> You can find some examples in the test fixtures.

> Write an algorithm that takes an array and moves all of the zeros to the end, 
> preserving the order of the other elements. 
> `move_zeros([False,1,0,1,2,0,1,3,"a"]) # returns[False,1,1,2,1,3,"a",0,0]`

> ROT13 is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the 
> letter 13 letters after it in the alphabet. ROT13 is an example of the Caesar cipher.   
> Create a function that takes a string and returns the string ciphered with 
> Rot13. If there are numbers or special characters included in the string, they 
> should be returned as they are. Only letters from the latin/english alphabet 
> should be shifted, like in the original Rot13 "implementation".   
> Please note that using encode is considered cheating.
